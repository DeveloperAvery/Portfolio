      <p> Hello, I'm Avery Hamilton! I'm a developer from Chicago, Illinois. </p>

    <!-- I made this div an article instead as it is the focus of my page with text about yours truly, me. -->
    <article>
      <h2 class="about-me" id="aboutMe"> About me:</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>I enjoy collaborating and connecting with others. In the past, people I've worked with have described me as incredibly friendly and optimistic. </p>
      
      <p>I'd love to bring that kind of energy with me on to any projects you'd like to hire me on for!</p>
      <!-- I decided to make the list text strong/bold to accent the way they're presented on the site. -->
      <p> I have experience with the following languages: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>JavaScript</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>HTML</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>CSS</strong> </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, I'm always happy to study more! The above languages are just the ones that I have been able to explore so far.</p>

      <p> Typically in my free time, I'll explore new things to do with code. When I need a mental break, you'll find me doing these kinds of activities: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Writing</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Designing games<small>(okay, this one might still include coding...)</small></strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cooking</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Playing games</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Watching shows</strong></li>
      </ol>
